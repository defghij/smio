Things I need to do:
- [ ] Add To/From traits for the Page<WORDS> type for serde read/writing.
    - [ ] implement using ByteMuck as in [this example](https://github.com/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs/blob/e449630774ab2ae73db056bbf7062708cc118318/virtual-display-driver/src/edid.rs#L31C32-L31C50)
- [ ] For performance monitoring, check out: https://github.com/larksuite/perf-monitor-rs. If this is light weight and high resolution way to get performance data then it maybe better than doing it "in-house"
